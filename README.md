# Practical Example: Car Sales
Used car price prediction using linear regression...

The purpose of this study is to learn about linear regression using Scikit-Learn package. It's mainly based on the data and code of "The Data Science Course 2022: Complete Data Science Bootcamp" in Udemy.
It's going to be a real life example about car sales. Data is messy so we need to

1. Clean the dataset
2. Go through some assumptions and relax some of them
3. Practice log transformation
4. Create a model
5. Create dummy variables to handle categorical features

What we would like to do is predict the price of a used car depending on it's specifications.
